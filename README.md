# Web-Security-Academy
I'm going to taking the challenge of solving all labs in the labs in web security academy. 
Just bear with me in this journey, it will be long but fun and exciting because many of this 
vulnerabilities can be exist in real world platform, and being able to replicate the thing
that you learn in these labs can help you gain a BIG reward by reporting them to HackerOne, 
BugCrowed, or Integrity. Whatever the hacking platform you signed up for happens to be.
